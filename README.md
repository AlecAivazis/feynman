A javascript application for creating feynman diagrams. Live at [feynman.aivazis.com](http://feynman.aivazis.com).

This repo started as a migration of my [original](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/feynman-old) feynman diagram
application to a leaner flask server. It then evolved from a [badly written angular 1.2 application](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/feynman/tree/angular1.x) to a less-badly written react/redux app. During that time,
the backend (responsible for rendering latex) was also rewritten from python to golang.

## Running the Tests

The tests are written using jest:

```bash
yarn && npm run test
```
